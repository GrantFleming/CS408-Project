\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Summary}

This project was concerned with description of type systems. We began
by conducting a range of background research in the field of
type-theory. We then expanded our research to include various subject
that might have helped us the the construction of a type-checker. We
designed a DSL that was capable of describing type systems. We then
wrote a type checker that was able to read such a description from a 
file, generate the type checker, then type-check code in the language it
described.

We believe that we are able to represent a broad range of
type-systems using our DSL and type-check all of these with the software we
provide. We also explore areas where both our DSL and our software
fall short. We finish by giving a qualitative evaluation of the DSL,
the software and our personal performance during the development
process. 

\section{Future Work}

There are many areas that could provide excellent areas for future
work.

One area of particular interest would be to explore the introduction
of Hindley-Milner style type inference. Clearly there are areas where
such inference is impossible in a dependently typed setting, but is it
such a black and white distinction? What exactly would a user have to
forgo in order to enjoy the convenience of this inference, and could
they choose to allow it in only certain places, yet still use
dependent types in others? This would be an excellent area for
exploration and it is not clear to us how it could be used effectively
for user specified type systems.

Another area of interest would be to consider an extension of the DSL
syntax to allow subtyping. Is there a sensible set of abstractions
that could be introduced here to allow the user to specifying the
mechanics of subtyping in a language while being prohibitive enough to
exclude some amount of nonsense that might be provided? This is
certainly worth further thought.

Finally we might explore how such a system as this might be combined
with a compiler-generator so that we might give specifications of
entire languages and get a fully fledged compiler with static
analysis.

\section{Conclusion}

We round off our report by simply stating that we are pleased with the
process and outcome of this project.

This project allowed us to learn a good mixture of some of the
theoretical underpinnings of type theory while also allowing us to
further develop our function programming skills. It familiarised us
with the reading of academic literature and taught us the value of
being precise in our definitions. We learned that being realistic is
easier but being amitious is more enjoyable. This project certainly
proved to be a major challange and we are better for it.
