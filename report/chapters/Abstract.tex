  Philip Wadler states that the Curry-Howard isomorphism is
  "a double-barrelled name that ensures the existence of other
  double-barrelled names" \cite{wadler2015}. By this he is of course
  referring to the deep isomorphism between logic and programming languages.
  
  It seems that many programming-language type systems are
  developed (or discovered depending on your school of thought) not
  once, but twice: once by a logician and once by a computer
  scientist. Unfortunately for the computer scientists, the logicians
  seem to beat them to the punch more often than not.

  It is with this in mind that we aim to shorten the
  timeframe from the development of new type systems to their
  implementation by doing what computer scientists do best:
  automating. We will aim to create a generic type checker that is
  able to check code according to a family of type-systems, so long as
  the type system is described to it.
  
  We begin by performing a general type theory literature review:
  taking the reader on a whirlwind tour of the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus
  \cite{church1940}, System F \cite{reynolds1974} and Hindley-Milner
  type theory \cite{hindley1969,milner1978,milner1982}
  before finally exploring Intuitionistic type theory
  \cite{martinlof1980} (sometimes known as Martin L\"{o}f type
  theory). We will then review some select literature relevant to
  to the implementation of various type-checker components and some
  meta-theory.

  Armed with our newly found knowledge we will develop a domain specific
  language (DSL) for describing type systems, paying special attention
  so as to not collect redundent information from the user.

  Finally we will put our DSL to good use by designing and
  implementing a type-checker-generator in Agda. This will take the
  form of a piece of software that receives, as its input, a
  specification file written in our previously developed DSL and a
  source code file in the language it describes. The software will then 
  type-check the source code according to the type-system described in
  the specification. 

  We will conclude by evaluating our type-checker-generator and our
  design and implementation process. Finally, we speculate as to how
  we might improve our software and finish by outlining possible areas
  for future work.
