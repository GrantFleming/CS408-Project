\chapter{Building a Type Checker Generator}

Now that a user has the means of describing a type system, focus will
be shifted onto the building of the system in question.

We will describe key aspects of our code as it is written by inluding
the code as literate agda files, however we hide areas of the code
from being rendered for brevity and so code shown here is not
complete and we often show only the type signature where the
implementation is tedius, long or irrelevant.

In order to make the code as concise and readable as possible we make
heavy use of Agda's implicit generalisation feature.
